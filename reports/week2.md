## Week 2: Model Training and Development

### Day 1-2: Fine-tune Ollama for Topic Extraction

Fine-tuning Ollama for topic extraction involves using the preprocessed datasets to train the model to recognize and extract key themes and concepts. Here's how you can approach this:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   Ensure your preprocessed data is ready for fine-tuning. This data should be structured in a way that the model can learn to identify topics from given texts.
2. **Fine-tuning Ollama**:
   As Ollama currently does not support fine-tuning directly, we can utilize prompt engineering to achieve the desired behavior.
3. **Setup**:
   Ensure you have installed the necessary packages and have the datasets ready.

```python
import ollama

# Function to extract topics
def extract_topics(text):
    stream = ollama.chat(
        model='llama3:70b',
        messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': f'Extract the main topics from the following text: {text}'}],
        stream=True,
    )
    topics = []
    for chunk in stream:
        topics.append(chunk['message']['content'])
    return topics

# Example usage
text = "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that aims to create machines that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. These tasks include things like visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation."
topics = extract_topics(text)
print("Extracted Topics:", topics)
```

This script utilizes the Ollama API to extract topics from a given text using the `llama3:70b` model.

#### Day 3-5: Train LLaMA 3 70B on the Dataset to Generate Open-Ended Questions

For training the LLaMA 3 70B model to generate open-ended questions, we will again rely on prompt engineering, as direct fine-tuning may not be supported.

1. **Data Preparation**:
   Prepare your dataset with context and examples of open-ended questions.
2. **Question Generation**:
   Use the model to generate questions based on the topics extracted in the previous step.

```python
import ollama

# Function to generate open-ended questions
def generate_questions(topic):
    stream = ollama.chat(
        model='llama3:70b',
        messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': f'Generate an open-ended question about the following topic: {topic}'}],
        stream=True,
    )
    questions = []
    for chunk in stream:
        questions.append(chunk['message']['content'])
    return questions

# Example usage
topic = "Artificial Intelligence"
questions = generate_questions(topic)
print("Generated Questions:", questions)
```

This script takes a topic and generates open-ended questions using the `llama3:70b` model.

#### Day 6-7: Develop Initial Prototype

The initial prototype should integrate both topic extraction and question generation functionalities. Here's a complete example:

1. **Combining Functions**:
   Create a script that combines both topic extraction and question generation.

```python
import ollama

# Function to extract topics
def extract_topics(text):
    stream = ollama.chat(
        model='llama3:70b',
        messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': f'Extract the main topics from the following text: {text}'}],
        stream=True,
    )
    topics = []
    for chunk in stream:
        topics.append(chunk['message']['content'])
    return topics

# Function to generate open-ended questions
def generate_questions(topic):
    stream = ollama.chat(
        model='llama3:70b',
        messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': f'Generate an open-ended question about the following topic: {topic}'}],
        stream=True,
    )
    questions = []
    for chunk in stream:
        questions.append(chunk['message']['content'])
    return questions

# Initial Prototype
def main(text):
    topics = extract_topics(text)
    print("Extracted Topics:", topics)
    for topic in topics:
        questions = generate_questions(topic)
        print(f"Questions for topic '{topic}':", questions)

# Example usage
text = "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that aims to create machines that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. These tasks include things like visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation."
main(text)
```

### Итоги

1. **Fine-tune Ollama**: Используйте инженерные приемы промптинга для извлечения тем.
2. **Тренировка LLaMA 3 70B**: Снова примените промптинг для генерации вопросов на основе тем.
3. **Прототип**: Создайте начальный прототип, который интегрирует функции извлечения тем и генерации вопросов.
